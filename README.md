# IoT-based-Hydroponic-System
# Description
This project leverages IoT technology to develop a smart hydroponic system that optimizes crop production. Using real-time sensor data and automation, the system monitors and controls key environmental factors to ensure efficient and sustainable farming. By adopting hydroponics, this project supports the future of smart agriculture with minimal dependency on soil-based farming.

# Features
  * Real-time Monitoring: Tracks essential environmental parameters such as pH, temperature, humidity, and nutrient levels.
  * Automated Control: Adjusts water, nutrients, and environmental conditions dynamically based on sensor feedback.
  * Data Analytics: Generates insights and visualizations to help users optimize farming practices.
  * Scalability: Modular design adaptable to various crop types and farm sizes.

  # Technologies Used
  * Hardware: Sensors (e.g., pH sensor, temperature & humidity sensors), microcontrollers (e.g., Arduino/Raspberry Pi).
  * Programming Languages: Python, C.
  * Data Pipeline: Real-time data collection and storage on a cloud platform.
  * Analytics Tools: Pandas, Matplotlib for data processing.
  *Database Influx, Grafana
